Programming Language:

Solidity is the main programming language used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. It is a statically typed language that looks like C++, JavaScript, and Python.

What is a smart Contract?
Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts can not be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.
