This is a simple example project that shows how to spin up an ethereum dap and how all of the project pieces should fit together. I have included an example smart contract for storing of hashes on the blockchain.

Rather than connecting to testnet or mainnet for ethereum I am using Ganache to spin up a private blockchain network on my PC as it simplifies the process of testing.

Please note that for this project I am using truffle network version 5.0.2
